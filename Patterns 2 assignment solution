Print the following pattern for n number of rows.
Note: each line consist of equal number of characters + spaces. Suppose you are printing xth line for N=n. You need to print 1..x followed by (n-x) spaces, again (n-x) spaces followed by x..1
For eg. N = 5 
solution:

def print_pattern(n):
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Print numbers in ascending order
        for j in range(1, i + 1):
            print(j, end='')
        
        # Print spaces
        for j in range(1, n - i + 1):
            print(' ', end=" ")
        
        # Print numbers in descending order
        for j in range(i, 0, -1):
            print(j, end="")

        print()

# Read the input
n = int(input())

# Call the function to print the pattern
print_pattern(n)
